I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.unc.edu/bios/biostatistics/) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Previously, I was a HDSI Fellow at the [Harvard Data Science Initiative](https://datascience.harvard.edu/) and a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the [Division of Biostatistics](https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/academics/biostatistics) at the University of California, Berkeley, where I was advised by Mark van der Laan. Before that, I earned a degree in Mathematics and worked as a research fellow at the Translational Genomics Research Institute.


My methodological research lies at the intersection of causal inference, non- and semi-parametric statistics, high-dimensional inference, efficiency theory, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in challenges arising in longitudinal and structured dependent settings, including adaptive sequential experiments, online learning, reinforcement learning, and broader applications in personalized health.
